# the{  }museum

the{ }museum is an exploratory online museum I designed and curated for my [Art Humanities]("http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/classes/arthum.php") class in Spring 2015.

Built on the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) boilerplate, with pretty parallax scrolling effects thanks to the voodoo of the [ScrollMagic]("http://scrollmagic.io") library.

Access the site at [http://constellationcolon.github.io/the-museum/]("http://constellationcolon.github.io/the-museum/").

View the code on the gh-pages branch of this repo.

Boundless thanks to [kenlimmj](https://github.com/kenlimmj) for his inexhaustible knowledge of JS libraries and front-end wizardry.
